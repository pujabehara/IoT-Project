# Hydro Smart Gardening using IoT
The Hydro Smart Garden utilizes IoT learning technologies, such as Arduino for hardware control, Google Apps Script for automation, ThingSpeak server for data management, and various sensors for monitoring and optimizing plant growth.
Abstract : Hydro smart gardening is an innovative agricultural approach that leverages IoT technology to conserve water resources and optimise plant growth. This project proposes a smart irrigation system designed for hydro smart gardening, integrating sensors and automation to monitor soil moisture levels, temperature, and humidity. The system's central hub, NodeMCU-ESP8266, collects real-time data from the sensors and transmits it to the ThingSpeak server for centralised storage and analysis. Additionally, Google App Script is utilised for further data management. Implementing this IoT-based approach enables gardeners to make data-driven decisions for efficient water management, promoting sustainable and environmentally friendly hydro smart gardening practices. This project significantly contributes to water conservation efforts and highlights the considerable benefits of incorporating IoT-driven smart irrigation in hydro smart gardening
